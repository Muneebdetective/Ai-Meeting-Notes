AI-optimized neighborhood: pre-cooling strategy keeps homes comfortable, batteries discharge during peak (each home becomes micro power plant), aggregate demand during peak 180 kW per home (47% reduction, 90 MW total), excess battery power sold back to grid at premium rates ($0.42/kWh vs $0.12 normal). Homeowner results: monthly electricity bill reduced from $340 (summer average) to $180 (47% savings), home comfort maintained perfectly, earned $45 selling power back to grid during peak, total monthly savings $205. Grid impact: peaker plant not needed (avoided $4.5M in infrastructure costs), renewable energy utilization increased 34% (solar energy stored rather than curtailed), grid stability improved, carbon emissions reduced 28%, $2.1M annual savings passed to ratepayers. Scaled to 50K homes citywide: creates 25 MW virtual power plant (equivalent to medium gas plant), 89% powered by renewables, eliminates 3 peaker plants ($120M infrastructure savings), reduces citywide electricity costs 12%, achieves grid decarbonization goals 8 years early. Each home AI system costs $2,400 (smart devices + installation), payback period 14 months from energy savings, then pure profit + environmental benefit.</p>
